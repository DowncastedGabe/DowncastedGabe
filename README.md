# üõ°Ô∏è Gabriel Alexsander Pessotti Locatelli | Cybersecurity Internship Candidate

> "Absolute security does not exist. What exists is risk management."

## üöÄ About Me

Hello! I am [Gabriel], currently a [1st] year student of [Information Security] at [Cruzeiro do Sul]. My passion for cybersecurity stems from a deep curiosity to understand how systems are built‚Äîand how they can be broken and, most importantly, **hardened**.

I am focused on building a solid foundation in the core pillars of security and applying that knowledge to practical scenarios. I am seeking an internship opportunity where I can actively contribute, learn from experienced professionals, and translate theoretical knowledge into effective security solutions.

* **Targeting Internships in:** SOC (Security Operations Center), Vulnerability Analysis, or Security Governance.
* **Email:** [downcastedgabe@gmail.com]

## üìö Foundations and Technical Knowledge

My knowledge base is centered on security principles and the core technologies essential to the field.

### 1. Security Principles

| Concept | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CIA Triad** | Understanding the pillars: **C**onfidentiality, **I**ntegrity, and **A**vailability. |
| **Common Attacks** | Foundational knowledge of the OWASP Top 10 (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, etc.) and mitigation techniques (sanitization, validation). |
| **Access Management** | Understanding AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Auditing) and Zero Trust concepts. |
| **Cryptography** | Differentiating between Symmetric (AES) and Asymmetric (RSA) cryptography, and the use of Hashing (SHA-256) for integrity. |

### 2. Networking and Systems

* **Networking (OSI Model):** Understanding layers and key protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS, DNS).
* **Operating Systems:** Familiarity with basic commands and file handling in **Linux (Kali/Ubuntu)** and **Windows**.
* **Cloud Computing:** Introductory knowledge of service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and fundamental cloud security principles.

### 3. Programming and Scripting

* **Python:** Intermediate proficiency. Focused on writing scripts for security automation tasks (log analysis, port scanning, data collection).
* **Bash/PowerShell:** Ability to write basic scripts for administration and task automation in Linux and Windows environments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Experience (Projects and Labs)


#### 1. Foundational Penetration Testing

* **Network Scanning (Nmap):** Practical use of Nmap for port enumeration, service identification, and vulnerability detection in authorized VMs. (Mention specific scanning techniques if possible, like NFS enumeration).
* **Password Cracking (John the Ripper):** Experience using John in *Wordlist* and *Single Crack* modes to test password strength and understand the fundamentals of dictionary attacks.
* **Web Vulnerability Analysis:** Hands-on practice with SQL Injection (SQLi) and XSS scenarios in controlled lab environments (e.g., OWASP Juice Shop, DVWA).

#### 2. Security Automation (Python)

* **[Scan_vuln](https://github.com/DowncastedGabe/Scan_vuln):** Developed a Python script to [This project was created to simplify and streamline the initial phase of a security audit or pentest. By providing an IP address, the script performs a detailed scan and presents a clear and organized report, highlighting the open ports and potential security flaws found, making it easier to analyze and make decisions.].
* **[URL_tester](https://github.com/DowncastedGabe/URLTester):** Created a simple utility in Python for [Track the chain of redirects (e.g., from HTTP to HTTPS, or from one subdomain to another)].
